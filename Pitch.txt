Hi, i am Diogo and i am a Junior Full Stack Developer.

One of my goals was exploring the tecnological world where i started to 
develop games using Unreal engine 4 from Epic Games, exploring 
Open Source Operating Systems such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu and Fedora and
the last one was sales manager, and for the last i've experienced with C#, 
ASP and PHP using 
Visual Studio 2017, java using Intellij Idea and Android Studio,
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js using Visual Studio Code.

I am a confident, responsible and punctual person, good listener, a good 
collaborator and 
organized person, 
can have multiple tasks to do but everything in certain
time, helpfull person in case of anyone having trouble with something.


Developing my game i aconplished one of my biggest goals, having some people 
that actually played and enjoyied my game and fixing any computer problems.
